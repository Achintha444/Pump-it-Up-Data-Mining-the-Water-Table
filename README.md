# Pump-it-Up-Data-Mining-the-Water-Table - UOM - CSE - 170638D
This is my attempt in participating in Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table competition.

## Summary of the Result
* Rank - 4117 (by 2021/09/16)
* Max Accuracy - 0.6339 (63.39%)
* Drivendata user name - moracse_170638D

## Files Included
* ML_Comp - Water Classification.ipynb - Is the initial version where I used explotary data analysis to get insights of the dataset
* ML_Comp - Water Classification_2.ipynb - Is the final version.

## Models Tried Out
* XG Boost Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Cat Boost Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gaussian NB
